<b>Context</b>
</h3>
"Are we alone in the universe?"
It is one of the deepest human questions. As technology improves, we find new and more powerful ways to search for answers. The motivation to communicate is also the biggest challenge. Human beings have built an enormous number of radio devices. It's hard to look for a faint alien transmission needle in the huge haystack of modern technology detections.

<b>Project Description</b>
</h3>
Current methods use two filters to search the haystack. Any signal that appears in both sets of scans is probably not coming from the direction of the target star. Second, the pipeline discards signals that don't change their frequency, because this means they are probably close to the telescope. A moving source should have a signal suggesting movement, similar to the change in pitch of a passing fire truck's siren. These two filters are quite effective, but we know that they can be improved. Undoubtedly, channeling misses interesting signals, particularly those with a complex time or frequency structure, and those in regions of the spectrum with a lot of interference.
This project aims to help identify anomalous signals in space

<b>Project Highlights</b>
</h3>
* There are no confirmed examples of extraterrestrial signals to use to train machine learning algorithms, the data source includes some simulated signals (which they call "needles") in the telescope's data haystack. This project has the potential to help answer one of the biggest questions in science.
